# Week 9 Input

#### Have you heard of the term C.R.U.D before?

<p> I have been using these types of app before without even realizing what they really were in the coding environment. When I took a brief JavaScript class prior to CIT-93 the term was covered and we ended up using some template code to create a Magic 8 Ball app. I can now see how most app nowadays are built with this type of functionality.

#### Can you write your own C.R.U.D app with guidance with the material covered so far?

<p> I have been enjoying the code-along videos but not so much the challenges to be honest. I still feel a bit overwhelmed by some of the concepts but have been making a bit of progress when it comes to seeing the bigger picture. Some of the syntax is still a challenge for me, where to create constants or where to call them. I feel really comfortable following along with the instructional videos and the explanations within them but I feel I am not ready to create something on my own just yet. <br>
A C.R.U.D app concept that came to mind was an inventory app. Something that keeps track of Video Games purchased as well as a wishlist. I'm thinking an api will come in handy for this.
