# Week 7 Loops and Arrays

### How am I improving my use of devTools

I have started to pay more attention to error lines more. It's such a time saver being able to pinpoint syntax or other errors shown by devTool. Sometimes the simplest of errors can take a long time to see, really glad to have this tool at my disposal!!


### Feedback

I had to take considerable long breaks between lessons which I believe made it a bit more challenging to grasp all the finer details of the week. Overall I enjoyed the lessons since they're are easy to follow but I am still struggling to understand the bigger picture. It's slowly sinking in but definitely need more practice and of course I need to dedicate a bit more time to outside research. <br>

Regarding the refactoring, I found myself struggling to understand the process, I know the code can be cleaned up and made more efficient but I think I just need a few more instances to see how different methods do the same thing.
