#### What is JSON?

From what I was able to understand, JSON is used to send data structures over the internet from server to client. In the case of the Mileage app, we are not able to access the arrays since they're set as objects but If we need to access a particular value within the object we would need to stringify it. By converting the array into a string  we are now able to access and send the information more efficiently. Once we use stringify, we can set and get items to local storage.
