## Are you using devTools?

It find myself using devTools a lot more now than I ever did while taking the intro to web classes. It's very helpful having the ability to breakdown your code and functions and seeing them work line by line. I have to admit that at the beginning it can be very intimidating and sometimes hard to know where to look but watching the videos helps me ease in into using the necessary features.

## Does the Array concept make sense?

I have to admit that I am struggling a bit with seeing the whole picture when it comes to arrays but I think I am beginning to grasp the general idea, basically arrays are objects with data inside of them. I hope that with more hands-on practice, I can understand them a bit better. So far so good, taking it slow.

## Fixing the issues after Array example?

Honestly I was not able to recognize the issue sorry.
