# Week 13 - Implementing Class into Mileage

---
## Challenge
### Where in the code can we implement the classes for the mileage program?

I believe we can setup the classes in the handleinput.js file and setup the miles, gallons and price as classes.


### List the things that broke after implementing the trip class and how can we fix them?

To be honest, I lost track of all the errors.
