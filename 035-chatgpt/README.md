## Thoughts on video about the future of AI

I noticed that the general consensus regarding ChatGPT and AI in the video was that everyone was excited about incorporating this new technology into their careers and lives. I agree on the points that, while Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are impressive at this point in time, they are still a long way to go for them to be of any real career threat that most people seem to be worried about.

I can see a lot more significant benefits when it comes to AI, its just that people need to understand that it needs to be seen as a complementary aspect of our lives/careers and not as a complete replacement for human interaction.

Another important point or question that stood out for me in the video was the creation of many, perhaps, private ChatGPT models that may come in the near future. It's definitely exciting to think that we could potentially see dozens or maybe hundreds of individual ChatGPT models within ten years.

Overall, I am glad to be exposed to this new technology. While a bit intimidating at time, I can see how in the new future, it will evolve to facilitate many aspects of our lives and careers. Definitely thrilled I got into tech!
