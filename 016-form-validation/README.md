# Week 8 Form Validation
---

#### Does the if, else statement make sense?
I think I have a grasp or a small understanding of the code in this instance. <br>

We're comparing the value of the user input to the value in the if, else statement. So we're saying that if the value is zero display the 'error message' otherwise run the trackMPGandCost function, forcing the user to input a value higher than zero.<br>

### Challenges

1. Clearing error messages once user submission is good

- was not successful at eliminating the error messages once correct data was introduced by user

2. Calculate average
- still unsure of how to approach this
