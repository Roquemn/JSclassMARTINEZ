#### Code in Module?

Would be interesting to see the app in Module form. The more practice with multiple concepts the better I believe. 


#### Creating branches and folders to store own Code

I honestly just have the main folders where we code along and leave some of my own code in there then commit. When we start a new lesson, I just go back to the previous version of the code and try to mirror exactly what the lesson for the day or week has me do. I would probably just add my own folders with my code from now on if I need to.
