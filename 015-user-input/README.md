#### Code in Module?

Would be interesting to see the app in Module form. The more practice with multiple concepts the better I believe. 


#### Creating branches and folders to store own Code

I honestly just have the main folders where we code along and leave some of my own code in there then commit. When we start a new lesson, I just go back to the previous version of the code and try to mirror exactly what the lesson for the day or week has me do. I would probably just add my own folders with my code from now on if I need to.


## Client Side Form Validation

Prior to taking coding classes, I had never consider the layout or functionality of forms that I would often complete while making purchases, signing up for websites or services. I often thought they were extremely sophisticated elements that I thought I would never had to breakdown. <br> 
Now that I am more familiar with the form concept I can actually pick up minor or even major design flaws, not so much the functionality because I am still a bit of a novice when it comes to forms, but if something seems off I can usually catch it. Most of the times, some websites will have flawed forms, that would not register user input and that would lead to abandoning the site all together.

### What event or function is being listened to in order to calculate user input data?

I believe were listening to the the data, in this case, the trackMPGandCost function. The user inputs the values in the spaces, the event is the submit button, and after that we output the calculated value after the submit button is pressed.
