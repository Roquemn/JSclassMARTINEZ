#### What is JSON?

From what I was able to understand, JSON is used to send data structures over the internet from server to client. In the case of the Mileage app, we are not able to access the arrays since they're set as objects but If we need to access a particular value within the object we would need to stringify it. By converting the array into a string  we are now able to access and send the information more efficiently. Once we use stringify, we can set and get items to local storage.


#### How well do you understand, the way we wrote code, to make data persist?

I've used local storage before but was just brief. This time around seeing it being implemented a second time it cleared some questions I had. For example the parsing, when to stringify then getting and setting items to local storage. The only issue I have is where to place the code. Hope with more practice I'll be able to identify the best placement for it and when to use it.
