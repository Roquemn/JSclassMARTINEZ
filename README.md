# Week 6 Video 1 My Thoughts

Hi Rio, 
I really appreciate how thorough and consistent you are about the material and each lesson you cover. Very excited to have you teaching us!

### Autosave and Integrated Terminal
- Thank you for reminding us about the autosave function and utilizing the integrated terminal. While taking your other class (CIT-82) and going through Todd's videos, I was a bit surprised some efficient things such as the git add * or the autosave function weren't covered. 
- I found a lot of the shortcuts Todd used came in handy quite a bit and were a great refresher. As well as the way Todd researched various topics by exploring and reading through their definitions.

### Commits
- having specific commit messages helps a lot and keeps the workflow more organized. Thank you for being detailed, it takes away a lot of the guessing work.
