## First Assignment

#### Is the syntax for writing function cleaner than using the arrow function?

I had no idea there was a big difference between the two ways of writing functions aside from making them look cleaner or sleeker. I guess the more code I write the more I'll get to see the advantages and disadvantages of both. But also as you mentioned in the video, It will depend on the company/firm on what type of style guide they want or need to code to be written in.

#### Where in the code do we start to render the table?

To render the table, the code will have to be added in the the function "updateDOM" I believe.

#### How do we create the tr with the row, and what are the contents within the row?

Still a bit unsure to be honest!

#### How do we fix the issue where the objects are not align with the headings?

Having a hard time coming up with a solution for this issue.
