#### Is the syntax for writing function cleaner than using the arrow function?

I had no idea there was a big difference between the two ways of writing functions aside from making them look cleaner or sleeker. I guess the more code I write the more I'll get to see the advantages and disadvantages of both. But also as you mentioned in the video, It will depend on the company/firm on what type of style guide they want or need to code to be written in.
